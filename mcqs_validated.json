The absence of fever and costovertebral angle tenderness makes pyelonephritis unlikely. Treatment guidelines for cystitis in pregnancy favor agents safe for the fetus. Nitrofurantoin is a first-line choice in the second trimester. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy. Ampicillin has high E. coli resistance rates, making it a poor empirical choice.

    "question": "A 40-year-old zookeeper presents to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain that radiates to her back, and nausea. The pain started 2 days ago and slowly increased until she could not tolerate it any longer. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hypothyroidism. Additionally, she reports that she was recently stung by one of the zoo\u2019s smaller scorpions, but did not seek medical treatment. She takes aspirin, levothyroxine, oral contraceptive pills, and a multivitamin daily. Family history is noncontributory. Today, her blood pressure is 108/58 mm Hg, heart rate is 99/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, she is a well-developed, obese female that looks unwell. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm. Radial pulses are weak but symmetric. Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her lateral left ankle is swollen, erythematous, and painful to palpate. An abdominal CT is consistent with acute pancreatitis.

      "summary": "The patient's clinical presentation, including severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, and CT findings, confirms a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The most probable etiology is the recent scorpion sting, strongly supported by her occupation as a zookeeper and the physical findings of a swollen, erythematous ankle (the likely sting site). This is a well-established causal link, represented by the specific concept 'Acute pancreatitis caused by scorpion sting'. While drug-induced pancreatitis from medications like aspirin or oral contraceptives is a possibility, the direct temporal relationship with the envenomation makes the scorpion sting the most compelling cause. Hypothyroidism is an unlikely etiology, particularly as the patient is receiving treatment.",

She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8-kg (15-lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands.

The underlying pathophysiology for the proptosis and extraocular muscle dysfunction is an autoimmune process stimulating orbital fibroblasts to produce excess hydrophilic glycosaminoglycans. This accumulation increases the volume of retro-orbital tissues (fat and extraocular muscles), leading to the patient's primary ocular complaints of proptosis and diplopia. While sympathetic hyperactivity contributes to lid retraction, it is the glycosaminoglycan accumulation that is the fundamental cause of the full orbital disease.",

The defining pathophysiological feature of COPD is persistent and progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow. This explains all her respiratory symptoms and signs. Option A (decreased compliance) and Option D (decreased functional residual capacity) are features of restrictive, not obstructive, lung disease; in COPD, both compliance and FRC are typically increased. Option B (local accumulation of kinins) describes the mechanism of an ACE inhibitor-induced cough, which is typically dry and non-productive, and would not account for the entire clinical syndrome.",

A major complication of CF is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, leading to fat malabsorption. This results in deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Vitamin K deficiency impairs the synthesis of clotting factors, which manifests as a coagulopathy detected by a prolonged prothrombin time (PT). The other options describe complications of water-soluble B-vitamin deficiencies (A: Riboflavin, B: Thiamine, C: Biotin), which are not the characteristic malabsorptive issues seen in CF.",

      "summary": "The patient's presentation with hepatitis (jaundice, dark urine, elevated aminotransferases) in a young adult, combined with the mention of a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain on liver biopsy, is highly suggestive of Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD). The pathognomonic finding on liver biopsy is PAS-positive, diastase-resistant globules within hepatocytes. A1AD is a genetic disorder leading to both liver disease (from accumulation of misfolded protein) and lung disease. The deficiency of circulating alpha-1 antitrypsin leads to unchecked elastase activity in the lungs, causing panacinar emphysema, which classically affects the lower lobes and appears as bullous changes on CT. The other options represent different liver diseases: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (beading of bile ducts), Hemochromatosis (myocardial iron deposition), and Wilson's disease (Kayser-Fleischer ring).",
